//! Recovery utilities for queues left in as inconsistent state, based on "best
//! effort" strategies. Use these functions if you need to automatically recover
//! from a failure.
//!
//! We offer two different approaches to queue recovery, which may be suitable to
//! different use cases:
//!
//! 1. Recover with replay (the standard): we can reconstruct a _lower bound_
//! of the actual state of the queue during the crash, which consists of the
//! _maximum_ of the following two positions:
//!     * the bottom of the smallest segment still present in the directory.
//!     * the position indicated in the metadata file.
//!
//! Since this is a lower bound, some elements may be replayed. If your
//! processing is _idempotent_, this will not be an issue and you lose no data
//! whatsoever.
//!
//! 2. Recover with loss: we can also reconstruct an _upper bound_ for the
//! actual state of the queue: the bottom of the second smallest segment in
//! the queue. In this case, the smallest segment is simply erased and the
//! receiver caries on as if nothing has happened. If replays are intolerable,
//! but some data loss is, this might be the right alternative for you. You can
//! limit data loss by constraining the segment size, configuring this option on
//! [`crate::SenderBuilder`].
